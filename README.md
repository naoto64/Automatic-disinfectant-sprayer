ATtiny13A automatic disinfectant sprayer.

## Usage
With this sketch, you can make an automatic disinfectant sprayer. The required parts are an ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04) and a servo (SG92R). When it comes within 15 cm from the sensor, the disinfectant is sprayed. When writing this sketch, be sure to set the clock frequency to "9.6MHz internal osc".
